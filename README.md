<h2 align="center">ABOUT ME</h2>

```
I am an aspiring data scientist with a passion for design and computing. I am driven by the endless possibilities 
of how data and design can come together to create meaningful and impactful experiences for users. I am 
constantly developing my skills in programming, data analysis, and visualization tools to stay at the forefront 
of these fields.

As a data scientist, I am dedicated to using data-driven insights to solve complex problems and create innovative 
solutions. I am proficient in statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms that enable me to analyze 
data and develop predictive models. My expertise in data visualization allows me to communicate insights to 
stakeholders in a clear and compelling way.

Moreover, my passion for design goes beyond data analysis, and I have honed my skills in UI/UX design, graphic 
design, and web development. I believe that design is critical in creating engaging and user-friendly experiences 
and strive to apply my design skills to every project I work on.

Overall, I am committed to continuous learning and growth in both the data science and design fields, and I am 
eager to tackle new challenges and opportunities.

My Top skills: User Experience Design (UED) • Figma (Software) • Python (Programming Language) • 
Julia (Programming Language) • Negotiations
